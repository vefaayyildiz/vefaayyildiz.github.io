# EDUCATION

## Florida Polytechnic University  
*Master of Science in Data Science, GPA: 3.96/4.00*  
**Thesis title**: *Utilizing Synthetic Image Generation with Large Language and Diffusion Models for Enhancing Autonomous Driving: A Case Study on Orange County (Florida) Emergency Calls Data*  
**Chair**: *Shahram Taj, Ph.D.*  
**Location**: Lakeland, FL, USA  
**Graduation date**: May 2024  

**Abstract**:  
This thesis explores the use of diffusion models and large language models to generate synthetic images that enhance the training data for autonomous driving algorithms. The study uses Orange County (Florida) emergency call data to create realistic and contextually relevant scenarios for improving safety systems in self-driving cars. By simulating real-world situations from emergency call data, this research contributes to safer autonomous vehicle operations.

## Izmir University of Economics  
*Bachelor of Science in Aerospace Engineering, GPA: 3.02/4.00*  
**Thesis title**: *Automated vehicle mirror adjustment using driver’s eye location*  
**Chair**: *Suha Bayindir, Ph.D.*  
**Location**: Izmir, Türkiye  
**Graduation date**: September 2021 (with Honors)

**Abstract**:  
The focus of this thesis is on developing an automated system to adjust vehicle mirrors based on the driver’s eye location. The system employs computer vision techniques to detect the driver's position and adjust mirrors for optimal visibility, improving driver safety and convenience. The system is designed for dynamic environments, adjusting in real-time as the driver’s position changes.
