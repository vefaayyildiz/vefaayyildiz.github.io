## Connected Wise LLC, Orlando, FL, USA  
**Computer Vision Systems Engineer**  
*December 2023 – Present*

- Spearheaded several innovative AI-driven computer vision projects, focusing on autonomous vehicles and traffic management systems.
- Engineered in-vehicle vision systems using CNN models alongside the BotSort algorithm. These systems enabled real-time detection and tracking of vehicles, pedestrians, and road signs, enhancing adaptive driving functions like cruise control and collision avoidance. Innovated methods for V2X message detection, pioneering a system that integrates vehicle communication with AI sensing.
- Developed and expanded infrastructure-based AI sensing technologies with Vision2X stack, improving traffic flow monitoring by analyzing long-term patterns and road user behavior. The BotSort algorithm strengthened object tracking accuracy, transforming traffic management capabilities by revitalizing detection systems for road safety.
- Initiated and executed a USDOT SBIR Phase 2 grant-funded project to innovate a Bridge Weight-In-Motion (BWIM) system for detecting overweight trucks. This involved calibrating camera projections and integrating real-time data from sensors and accelerometers, enhancing axle detection and vehicle classification accuracy.

## Connected Wise LLC, Orlando, FL, USA  
**Intern Deep Learning Researcher & Data Scientist**  
*May 2023 – December 2023*

- Led data preparation efforts by organizing and systematizing large datasets from traffic cameras across multiple states. Trained deep learning models such as YoloV8 and EfficientDet to detect vehicles, axles, and license plates, improving model stability and detection accuracy.
- Implemented AutoVision software into automotive systems, enabling real-time environmental perception and improving driving safety through high-precision detection of road users, traffic signs, and lane lines. The software's performance was benchmarked against industry standards, demonstrating a competitive edge in autonomous driving technologies.

## Florida Polytechnic University, Lakeland, FL, USA  
**Graduate Teaching Assistant**
