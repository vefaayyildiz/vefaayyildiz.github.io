"A strong body makes the mind strong" has always been my philosophy when it comes to both sports and life. Scientifically, the link between an active body and the release of happiness hormones is well-established, and it's clear that these hormones help create more productive individuals. That's why, for years, running 5Ks three times a week has been an essential part of my life. In addition to this, living in Florida means I adapt my activities based on the weather. During hurricane season, I figure skate four times a week, but when the weather is clear, I surf twice a week and skate three times a week.

Every morning, I start my day with yoga and Pilates, and in the evening, I finish with light strength training. In the winter, I love snowboarding, and Iâ€™m also passionate about traveling, visiting museums, discovering new places, and working on cars. One of my favorite hobbies is exploring archaeological sites. Every month, I choose new places to visit based on an archaeology magazine that I follow closely, and I make travel plans accordingly.

I consider my work and academic life to be things I genuinely enjoy, so I count them as part of my hobbies as well!

I hope these little insights into my life bring a smile to your face. And first, I'd like to take a moment to express how lucky I feel to have my sister as my sister. To share more with you, here are a few photos of my life. Enjoy!
